            -   **Disabled Inactive GitHub Pages**: Deactivated the unconfigured `deploy-pages.yml` workflow, eliminating automated exit code failures on `main`.
            -   **Streamlined Daily CI & CodeQL**: Moved CodeQL analysis to a weekly Sunday background schedule and lightweighted daily CI checks, cutting commit build times to under 2 minutes.
        -   **[Installer] Custom Directory & Multi-Drive Path Selection (Inherited from v5.0.1)**:
            -   Configured NSIS `installMode: "both"` to grant users complete freedom to select custom installation drives/folders (e.g. `D:\...`) without administrator permission blocks or setup aborts.
    *   **v5.0.1 (2026-09-07)**:
        -   **[Installer Fix] NSIS Custom Directory & Permission Abort Resolution**:
            -   Fixed installation failure when users selected non-default directories or lacked root administrator privileges by switching NSIS installer mode to `installMode: "both"`.
        -   **[CI & Maintenance] Dependency Caching & Repository Synchronization**:
            -   Introduced Rust dependency caching for Windows runners and synchronized release metadata and endpoints to `DoctorGuidance/Antigravity-Shield`.
    *   **v5.0.0 (2026-09-07)**:
        -   **[Release] Antigravity Shield v5.0.0 - Hardened Enterprise AI Account Manager & Gateway**:
            -   **Full Antigravity Shield Enterprise Rebranding**: Complete UI/UX, localized strings, Settings, about information, and package metadata overhaul from legacy Antigravity Tools to DoctorGuidance / Antigravity Shield.
            -   **Security Hardening & CodeQL Compliance**: Eliminated CWE-312 / CWE-359 clear-text storage alerts via authenticated cipher storage layer (`secureStorage.ts`) for browser tokens and key managers. Sanitized test harnesses to prevent stack trace leaks.
            -   **Dependabot & Supply Chain Hardening**: Resolved all 70 npm security vulnerabilities (0 vulnerabilities remaining). Updated critical Rust network dependencies (`tar`, `rustls-webpki`).
            -   **Multi-Platform Automation**: Automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for building Windows (`.exe` NSIS installer), macOS (`.dmg`, Universal `.app`), and Linux (`.AppImage`, `.deb`).
